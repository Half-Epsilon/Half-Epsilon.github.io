## Welcome to Half Epsilon

Half Epsilon is a digital asset custody tech provider. 

Blockchains were not designed for institutions. They are too public, too slow and offer variable transaction costs. As institutions enter the tokenized world, a new technology is required to enable the transfer of tokens between institutions in a compliant and confidential manner. Half Epsilon provides such a technology.

Our technology also gives Banks and Financial Institutions a genuine opportunity to tokenize traditional financial instruments.  

We are actively seeking opportunities to pilot our technology. If interested, please reach us at ```hello@halfepsilon.com```
