## Welcome to Half Epsilon


Half Epsilon should interest you if you are a technical or a business leader in the **Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)** industry. We are a deep tech startup developing technology that addresses several pain-points of VASPs. 

Blockchains were not designed for institutions. As institutions enter the digital assets space, a new technology is required to enable the transfer of digital assets between institutions. Half Epsilon provides such a technology.

For details, please read our [whitepaper.](DACTSv1.pdf) 

We are actively seeking opportunities to pilot out technology. If interested, please reach us at ```hello@halfepsilon.com```


### Concerns of the VASP Industry

The VASP industry has a common set of concerns. 

**Transfer Related Concerns**

- How to reduce **settlement latencies**? 
- How to maintain **confidentiality** of digital asset transfers? 
- How to deal with **variable transaction fees** offered by blockchains? 
- How to comply with regulations, specifically **FATFâ€™s Travel Rule**? 

**Storage Related Concerns**

- How do we store digital assets securely and protect against **outsider theft**? 
- How to protect against **insider theft**? 


### No Holistic Solution

- The Blockchain Hardware Security Modules (HSM) industry is focused on solving the storage related concerns. 
- Recently, the InterVASP Messaging Standard (IVMS-101) has been developed to aid Travel Rule Compliance. 
- Several concerns remain unaddressed. No holistic solution.
