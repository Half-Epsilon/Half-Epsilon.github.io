You should continue reading if you are a security architect, technical leader or a business leader in the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) industry. 

### VASP Concerns

VASP concerns can be grouped into two categories; concerns related to storage of digital assets and concerns related to transfers of digital assets. 

Storage Related Concerns

- How do we store digital assets securely? 
- How to protect against insider theft? 

Transfer Related Concerns

- How to transfer digital assets instantly? 
- How to maintain confidentiality of digital asset transfers? 
- How to deal with variable transaction fees offered by blockchains? 
- How to comply with regulations, specifically FATFâ€™s Travel Rule? 

Custody solutions in the market today do address storage related concerns to a large extent. But concerns related to digital asset transfers remain unaddressed. Half Epsilon DACTS offers a holistic solution to both types of concerns. VASPs on the Half Epsilon Network can transfer digital assets to each other in a peer-to-peer fashion without any intermediaries.
