### Concerns of the VASP Industry

The VASP industry has a common set of concerns. 

**Storage Related Concerns**

- How do we store digital assets securely? 
- How to protect against insider theft? 

**Transfer Related Concerns**

- How to transfer digital assets instantly? 
- How to maintain confidentiality of digital asset transfers? 
- How to deal with variable transaction fees offered by blockchains? 
- How to comply with regulations, specifically **FATFâ€™s Travel Rule**? 

### No Holistic Solution

- The Blockchain Hardware Security Modules (HSM) industry is focused on solving the storage related concerns. 
- Recently, an InterVASP Messaging Standard (IVMS-101) has been developed to aid Travel Rule Compliance. 
- Several concerns remain unaddressed. No holistic solution.
