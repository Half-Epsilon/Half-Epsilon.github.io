## Welcome to Half Epsilon

Half Epsilon has solved the Double Spend Prevention problem again. We believe this will unlock a huge amount of value. 
Last time this problem was solved in 2008 and it created a $1T economy. 

We are a digital asset custody and transfer tech provider. 

Blockchains were not designed for institutions. They are too public, too slow and offer variable transaction costs. As institutions enter the tokenized world, a new technology is required to enable the transfer of tokens between institutions in a compliant and confidential manner. Half Epsilon provides such a technology.

Our technology also gives Banks and Financial Institutions a genuine opportunity to tokenize traditional financial instruments.
