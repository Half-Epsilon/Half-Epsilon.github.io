### Concerns of the VASP Industry

The VASP industry has a common set of concerns. 

**Storage Related Concerns**

- How to protect against insider theft? 

**Transfer Related Concerns**

- How to transfer digital assets instantly? 
- How to maintain confidentiality of digital asset transfers? 
- How to deal with variable transaction fees offered by blockchains? 
- How to comply with regulations, specifically **FATFâ€™s Travel Rule**? 

### No Holistic Solution
