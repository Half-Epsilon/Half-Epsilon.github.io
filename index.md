## Welcome to Half Epsilon

Half Epsilon is a digital asset custody tech provider. 

We are a deep tech startup developing technology that addresses several pain-points of Digital Asset Custodians and Virtual Asset Service Providers. 

Blockchains were not designed for institutions. They are too public and offer variable costs. As institutions enter the digital assets space, a new technology is required to enable the transfer of digital assets between institutions. Half Epsilon provides such a technology.

We are actively seeking opportunities to pilot out technology. If interested, please reach us at ```hello@halfepsilon.com```
