## Welcome to Half Epsilon


Half Epsilon's goal is to make value move around the world as easily as information. Our product, the One Time Spend Machine (OTSM), is capable of performing localized double spend prevention. A network of OTSMs can transfer tokenized assets among themselves in a peer-to-peer (point-to-point) fashion without using intermediaries for transaction processing.

[Inter-bank Payments with Tokenized Fiat Currencies](Inter-bank-Payments.pdf)

Notice that there is no such thing as a correspondent bank in the crypto-economics world. People "bank" with crypto-currency exchanges that offer services in their jurisdictions. If alice@coinbase, a resident of the US wants to transfer BTC to bob@coinhako, a resident of Singapore, she may do so in real time. Can we bring in this concept to the banking world? Can cross-border inter-bank payments be made without correspondent banks? The answer is yes. A key enabler is bank issued Tokenized Fiat Currencies. A second key enabler is Half Epsilon's One Time Spend Machine.  Please see the link above.
