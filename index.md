## Welcome to Half Epsilon

There seems to be significant interest from banks and FIs in exploring tokenized assets. Some banks are moving past crypto-currencies and into tokenized fiat currencies and securities. 

A tokenized asset is different from a digitized asset in one special way. A tokenized asset can move from one institution to another easily. 

However, blockchains are an extremely poor choice of technology for moving tokenized assets between banks. There are confidentiality and compliance issues in using this technology. 

Half Epsilon has developed a product called the One Time Spend Machine (OTSM). This product is capable of performing localized double spend prevention. A network of OTSMs can transfer tokenized assets among themselves in a peer-to-peer (point-to-point) fashion without using intermediaries for transaction processing. Each OTSM can be monitored by a governor entity to ensure compliance with AML and CTF guidelines.

There is large interest in tokenizing real world assets.  Half Epsilon's One Time Spend Machine is a technology to enable tokenization, secure custody and institution-to-institution transfer of tokenized assets without intermediaries or blockchains. Please see the link above. 

[Inter-bank Payments with Tokenized Fiat Currencies](Inter-bank-Payments.pdf)

Notice that there is no such thing as a correspondent bank in the crypto-economics world. People "bank" with crypto-currency exchanges that offer services in their jurisdictions. If alice@coinbase, a resident of the US wants to transfer BTC to bob@coinhako, a resident of Singapore, she may do so in real time. Can we bring in this concept to the banking world? Can cross-border inter-bank payments be made without correspondent banks? The answer is yes. A key enabler is bank issued Tokenized Fiat Currencies. A second key enabler is Half Epsilon's One Time Spend Machine.  Please see the link above.
